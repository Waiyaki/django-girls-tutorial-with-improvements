Issues with this version:
    - Updated registration, but any logged in user
      can edit/delete any blog even if they weren't the authors.
      That should be fixed.
    - Only one blog, Marioshoni, exists. Each registered user should be
      given their own blogs.
      That should be fixed.
    - Yet to redesign the forms.
